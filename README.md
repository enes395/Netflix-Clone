# Netflix iOS Clone
This is the project where I developed a netflix ios application clone to learn MVVM architecture, UIKit, Swift and networking.

List movies and tv shows according the categories, such as, Trending Movies, Top rated Tv shows, or Upcoming Movies etc.

The app has 4 main screen, same as netflix itself, Home, Upcoming, Top Search and Downloads
